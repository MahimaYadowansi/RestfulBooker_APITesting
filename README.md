# RestfulBooker_APITesting
# Project Overview
 - This project involves testing the RestFul Booker API, simulating real-world testing scenarios using various HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). The API is used to manage bookings, create tokens, and authenticate users, among other functions.
 # TestURL: 
 - https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com
#  Test Scripts
    - Each of the requests in this collection includes associated tests to validate the response:
        -	Status code validation: Verifies if the response status is 200
        -	Response body validation: Checks if specific properties exist in the response body
        -	Content-Type validation: Ensures the response has the correct content type (application/json).
#  Tools Used
-	Postman: Used for creating, sending requests, and validating responses.
-	Postman Scripts: JavaScript used within Postman to validate response status, body content, and headers.
-	API Authentication: Basic authentication was used for some of the endpoints (e.g., Booking - GetBooking).
